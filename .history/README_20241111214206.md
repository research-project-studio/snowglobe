# snowglobe
webmap archiver project

## Intent
This project will seek to use HAR files to programmatically download and archive webmaps. The project will be written in Python and will use the Selenium library to interact with web browsers. The core functionality of the project will be to download webmap tiles and metadata from a webmap and store them in a tile file (pmtiles). The project will also include a web interface that will allow users to view the archived webmaps.

## Project Structure
The project will be divided into two main components: the webmap archiver and the web interface. The webmap archiver will be responsible for downloading and archiving webmaps, while the web interface will allow users to view the archived webmaps. The interface will include a lightweight python server to make the "snowglobes" as standalone as possible. Similarly, all third-party scripts will be included in the project to make it as self-contained as possible.
