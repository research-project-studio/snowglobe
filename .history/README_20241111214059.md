webmap archiver project

## Intent
This project will seek to use HAR files to programmatically download and archive webmaps. The project will be written in Python and will use the Selenium library to interact with web browsers. The core functionality of the project will be to download webmap tiles and metadata from a webmap and store them in a tile file (pmtiles). The project will also include a web interface that will allow users to view the archived webmaps.
